//! The pointer message, opcode 9.
//!
//! Thirteen bytes of header then twenty-one of body, and optionally an image
//! after that. Two forms share the layout: one carries the picture, the other
//! names a picture the far side already has.
//!
//! **Three states travel here and none of them implies another**
//! (docs/05-host.md section 8.1). Hidden is what an application asked for and
//! is what relative mode is derived from; suppressed is the pointer withheld
//! because somebody is using touch, and is not relative; whether a pointer is
//! being drawn at all is a third thing again.
